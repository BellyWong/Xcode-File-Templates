## Xcode File Templates

This is a collection of file templates for Xcode.

### INSTALLATION

Clone this repository somewhere on your filesystem, and then execute the
following command from the newly-cloned repository directory:

    ln -s "$PWD/File Templates" ~/Library/Application\ Support/Developer/Shared/Xcode

If you already have a File Templates directory in that location, you may instead choose
to symlink each individual subfolder in to the existing directory.

### USAGE

In Xcode select the File->New Fileâ€¦ menu item. There should be a section called "User Templates"
which contains all of the file templates.
